Role Dashboard is a solution for any staffing company to track their candidates.

## Features

* **Database Integration:** Whenever new clients are added, their information is saved to a central database. This speeds the entry of new roles by saving you key presses!
* **Feature-Rich Drop Downs:** Rather than be bombarded with text inputs, information is entered through the use of feature-rich drop downs. If you do not see an option that fits the role, just begin typing and you can add another option immediately.
* **Fast Searches:** Have hundreds of roles and need to find one quick? Just hover your mouse on the column header you want to search, click "Filter', and find the role instantly
* **Customized View:** Want to see a custom view? Easily hide any columns you don't want to see at the click of a butotn.
